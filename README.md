My presentations for Meet Magento Romania 2015.

One is about how to make a CMS out of Magento 2, by removing all the module related to e-commerce. 
I successfully added a new module to manage blog-posts or news (what ever you want) as a proof of concept.  

The other one is a tutorial on what files you need to create in order to make a magento 2 CRUD module.  


Some of the slidex may not make sense out of context. 
If something is unclear post them as issues in this repo and I will answer what I can.
